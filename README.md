# Skrivanek-Tag

A program to create new projects, in the right place, super super quick and how I want it, because I am lazy and impatient.

On the technical aspect, it is a Powershell script, written in imperative style, using Windows.Forms as GUI and compiled into PS2EXE. 

I am learning powershell as i write and expand it. Its bound to have some ugly and some clever code.

The manual is for coworkers who may want to use it.
